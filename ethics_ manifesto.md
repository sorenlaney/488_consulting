## Ethics Manifesto 

***

## Overview 

Without a guide to ethics, every Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Software Engineer or Analyst fights a conflict of interest internally everyday between what is best for the company and what is best for the community. What is benifits the business one is working for and what benifits society are often two very different things. Ethics can be compared to flying a plane or sailing a ship where it is imperative to set a course to not get lost or arrive at the wrong destination. 


#### **Ethics Definition** - *Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.*

#### **Moral Definition** - *A person's standards of behavior or beliefs concerning what is and is not acceptable for them to do.*



## Understanding Ethics 





## Areas of Focus 

#### Design and Intended Use 
When desiging a ml model the use needs to be thourghly thought through and the result of the project should not be used to the detriment of society. A well planned project can benifit a company and society by furhter generating revenue and gdp. However, a poorly designed model can adversly affect intentionally or not. A great example of this is where machine learning models bult for insurance companies created red lines around minorty communities. This can disporportionally affect certian ethnic groups and is all caused by a poor design and thought process from the data scientist. 

#### Data Privacy & Rights
As time progrosses privacy is considerded more and more as a natural born right so it is the least one can do to follow the laws around data privacy. However, it is a datascientists duty to further analyze any potential issues with data collection, interpretation and presentation. 

#### Intention 


#### Project Transparency
