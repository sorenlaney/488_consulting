## Ethics Manifesto 

***

## Overview 

Without a guide to ethics, every Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Software Engineer or Analyst fights a conflict of interest internally everyday between what is best for the company and what is best for the community. What is benifits the business one is working for and what benifits society are often two very different things. Ethics can be compared to flying a plane or sailing a ship where it is imperative to set a course to not get lost or arrive at the wrong destination.
