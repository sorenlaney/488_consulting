## Personal Improvements 

#### Programing 

I was able to have a better understanding of how to use and colloaborate using github with team members. I also increased my knowledge on how to create modular data science solutions using services such as aws and S3 buckets alongside  traditional tools such as R Studio. 

#### Exploratory Data Ananlysis (EDA)

This was tbhe first real world application of using EDA to create a data science tool that will be used in the day to day of the clietns business. The EDA allowed us to move forward with project with more clarity in how the data is inter-related and will provide value to the client. It also helped us understand specific trends in the in relation to to Gets and Posts and also the work appliucations. 

#### Teamwork 

I became better at asking precise questions to the team and especially in giving precise questions to answers. Our entire team was also very busy this semester so learning how to work in conjunction with each others schedules was vital. 

#### Goals upon Graduation
Upon graduation I plan to implement the skills and processes that I learned at in the data science program into the business that myself and my wife run. 




## Team Members 

#### Mike Min (Team Member)
Mike was a great contributor to the team. He came up with the idea of using power bi as a dashboard and work to get a demo product working which he brought to one of meetings and showed to us and sold us on the idea of using power bi to fullfill the needs of client for this project. 

#### Ian Grey (Team Member)

Ian was instrumental in creating the queries that pull the data from the S3 bucket into power bi. He did this using r and it was really amazing to see how powerful the scripts are that he can wright. 

#### Adam Romeli (Team Leader) 

Adam did a great job leading us to do our best work during this project. He was very professional in meetings and did a great job incorporating us into the meetings as well. I think there could have been more planning after the objectives of the project were layed out.
